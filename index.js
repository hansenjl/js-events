//As a developer I want...

//a form to appear in place of the 'Add Emoji' button when the 'Add Emoji' button is clicked
//an emoji can be entered into the input, submitted, and added to the "Emoji Bank"
//an alert saying "Emoji Submitted!" whenever an emoji is submitted
//the form turns back into the 'Add Emoji' button once an emoji has been successfully submitted
//an emoji I click on turns into 'ðŸ¤ª'
